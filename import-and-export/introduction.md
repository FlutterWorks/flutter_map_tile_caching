# Introduction

{% hint style="success" %}
The [`fmtc_plus_sharing`](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/fmtc\_plus\_sharing) module is required to use the import/export functionality.

See the [#fmtc\_plus\_sharing-installation-and-setup](../get-started/additional-setup.md#fmtc\_plus\_sharing-installation-and-setup "mention") instructions to add this module.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before using FMTC, especially to bulk download, ensure you comply with the appropriate restrictions and terms of service set by your tile server. Failure to do so may lead to any punishment, at the tile server's discretion.

This library and/or the creator(s) are not responsible for any violations you make using this package.

Some common tile servers' ToS are listed below:

* [OpenStreetMap](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles)
* [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/legal/tos)
* [Thunderforest](https://www.thunderforest.com/terms/)
* [Stadia Maps](https://stadiamaps.com/terms-of-service/)
{% endhint %}

It is possible to [export](exporting.md) an entire store (including tiles and metadata) to a standalone file that can be easily shared and distributed between devices, then [imported](importing.md) on any device.

For example, they can be used to create backup systems, sharing systems, or to distribute a preset package of tiles to all users without worrying about managing IO or managing assets!
