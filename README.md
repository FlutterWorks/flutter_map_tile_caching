### Trusted by many

In addition to our generous [supporters](supporters.md), FMTC is also trusted and [used by businesses](#user-content-fn-8)[^8] all around the world:

### How can FMTC elevate my app to the next level?

Too easy :smile:! Take a look at Google Maps, or Strava, or whichever other app of your choice.

<details>

<summary>All I see are rectangles. I don't want rectangles.</summary>

Whether it's walking along a remote winding river using the [Line region](bulk-downloading/regions.md#poly-line), downloading all of central London ready for that weekend exploration using the [Circle region](bulk-downloading/regions.md#circle) (roaming fees + maps gets expensive fast!), or tracking your belongings across a vast, shapeless space using the [Custom Polygon region](bulk-downloading/regions.md#custom-polygon), FMTC has your user's back - but not all of their storage space!

<details>

<summary>There's too much blue in my map. Can I avoid storing useless sea tiles?</summary>

With Sea Tile Skipping, you can avoid storing those unneccessary tiles of sea, then use the map client's functonality to just paint the spaces the same color as the sea. This also preserves sea tiles that aren't so empty after all - that boat path could come in handy. Just another way FMTC keeps your user's phone bloat free ;)

</details>

<details>

<summary>I need to download something else for a moment. Do I really have to stop the entire download and start again?</summary>

Not with FMTC! Downloads can be paused and resumed at any time, and with Download Recovery, downloads that stopped unexpectedly can be started right from where they left off, without your user even knowing something went wrong.

<summary>I wonder how much it costs the app developers?</summary>

FMTC supports bulk downloading from any tile server\*[^9], so you can choose whichever one suits you best.

Our browse caching mechanism doesn't result in any extra requests to the tile server, and in fact can reduce costs by serving tiles to users from their local cache without cost. Or, if you're running your own server, you can reduce the strain on it, keeping it snappy with fewer resources!

Downloads can be rate limited to avoid running up to the server's rate limit or excess fee.

And with export/import functionality, user's can download regions just once, then keep the download themselves for another time. Or, you can provide a bundle of tiles to all your user's, while still allow it to be updated per-user in future!\*[^10]

[^1]: Keep your users' tiles organized, and even let them control what goes where!

[^2]: Tiles can belong to multiple stores, and tiles from different sources (template URLs) can be stored in a single store!

[^3]: Download rectangles, circles, line-based, and any other freehand polygon!

[^4]: Avoid downloading redundant, waste-of-space tiles that cover oceans, with this unique functionality, and bless your users with the gift of more usable capacity for useful maps!

[^5]: Bulk downloads come with the ability to pause, resume, and cancel downloads mid-way! Give your users choice.

[^6]: Downloading from a server with a rate limit? No problem: just enable rate limiting and we'll do our best to stick to it!

[^7]: Speed is very dependent on tile server ability, network delays, and device processing power. Actual speed is likely to be considerably lower.



    1500 tiles was tested from the included testing tile server running on localhost, on a Windows 11 (Intel 12th Gen i7-12700H CPU & DDR5 4800MHz RAM) with 10 downloading threads & a buffer of 500 tiles.

[^8]: Disclaimer: these projects/businesses use FMTC licensed under an [alternative proprietary license](./#proprietary-licensing).

[^9]: Those compatible with flutter\_map. Some tile server's may forbid bulk downloading.

[^10]: Some tile servers may forbid this activity. Check your tile server's ToS.
