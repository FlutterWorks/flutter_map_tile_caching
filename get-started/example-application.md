# Example Application

This package contains a full example application - prebuilt for Android and Windows by GitHub Actions - showcasing the most important features of this package and its modules.

{% hint style="info" %}
The example app isn't intended for beginners or as a starting point for a project. It is intended for evaluation purposes, to discover FMTC's capabilities, and how it might be implemented into an app.

To start using FMTC in your own app, please check out the [quickstart.md](quickstart.md "mention") guide instead.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
The example application pairs perfectly with the testing tile server included in the FMTC project: [#testing-your-application](../bulk-downloading/introduction.md#testing-your-application "mention")!
{% endhint %}

## Android

Download a copy of the latest 'android-demo' artifact from GitHub Actions, and install the APK inside.

{% hint style="info" %}
The operating system may request permissions to install applications from unknown sources: you must allow this.
{% endhint %}

## Windows

Download a copy of the latest 'windows-demo' artifact from GitHub Actions, and run the executable inside to install the application. Optionally grant administrator permissions to install for all users.

{% hint style="info" %}
You may receive security warnings depending on your system setup: these are false positives and occur due to the package being unsigned.
{% endhint %}

## Other Platforms

For other platforms, there are no prebuilt applications.

Clone the [FMTC GitHub repository](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/flutter\_map\_tile\_caching/) to your device, then run/build the Flutter project directory found under '/example/'.
