# 3âƒ£ Start In Foreground

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before using FMTC, ensure you comply with the appropriate rules and ToS set by your tile server. Failure to do so may lead to a permanent ban, or any other punishment.

This library and/or the creator(s) are not responsible for any violations you make using this package.

OpenStreetMap's can be [found here](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles): specifically bulk downloading is discouraged, and forbidden after zoom level 13. Other servers may have different terms.
{% endhint %}

Finally! Now you can start downloading the region. There's many customization options available, so we recommend reading through the API documentation for the `startForeground` method.

```dart
FMTC.instance('storeName').download.startForeground(
    region: downloadableRegion,
    // Many more options available!
).listen((evt) {});
```

{% hint style="success" %}
You should always monitor the progress of the download.

This is done by listening to the stream returned by the `startForeground` method. The `DownloadProgress` object contains enough information to create a complex UI to keep the user fully informed.
