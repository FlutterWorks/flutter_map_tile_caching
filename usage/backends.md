# Backends

FMTC supports attachment of any custom storage mechanism, through an `FMTCBackend`. This allows users to pick their favourite database engine, or conduct in-memory testing.

{% hint style="success" %}
Only one backend is built-into FMTC: the `FMTCObjectBoxBackend`. This backend uses the [ObjectBox library](https://pub.dev/packages/objectbox) to store data.
